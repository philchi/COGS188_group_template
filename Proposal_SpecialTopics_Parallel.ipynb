    "# Topic and outline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main topic\n",
    "Synthetic gradients are a technique used in neural networks to facilitate model parallelism, enhancing training efficiency by decoupling layers within the network. This approach alleviates the bottleneck caused by traditional synchronous gradient descent, enabling faster and more scalable training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning goal for students \n",
    "Students will be able to understand the concept of synthetic gradients and their potential role in enabling efficient model parallelism in neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline of the topic\n",
    "- Introduction to Neural Networks\n",
    "  - Neural Network Basics: Brief overview of neural network architecture and functionality.\n",
    "  - __Understanding Model Parallelism__: Explanation of the benefits of parallelizing neural network models.\n",
    "- Synthetic Gradients\n",
    "  - __The Challenge of Synchronous Training/Three Lockings__: Discussion on the limitations posed by synchronous gradient descent in parallel training scenarios.\n",
    "  - __Synthetic Gradient Concept__: Definition and intuition behind synthetic gradients.\n",
    "  - Implementation and Application: Overview of how synthetic gradients are integrated into neural network training algorithms.\n",
    "- Demonstrative Example\n",
    "  - Practical Demonstration: Application of synthetic gradients using a simple dataset, possibly CIFAR-10.\n",
    "  - Insights from Demonstration: Discussion on the observed improvements in training efficiency and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional notes\n",
    "- Given the varied backgrounds of students, we choose to include neural network basics in the outline. However, if most students are familiar with neural networks, we can skip this part.\n",
    "- We plan to focus on intuitive understanding rather than heavy mathematical details. We can cover a bit more on math if there is enough time.\n",
    "- Instead of using the example of RNN running on different time clocks (i.e. the example used in the essay), we might want to use an alternative example. So far, we are considering training a upstream and several downstream models simultaneously.\n",
    "  - This is mainly because we cannot assume students are familiar with back propagation through time and we are not planning to cover that.\n",
    "- It might be a bit hard for us to demonstrate how synthetic gradients speed up the training process but we can at least demonstrate that synthetic gradients work."

    "- This blog covers the high level concept behind synthetic gradients. It describes the problems people face when trying to train neural networks and how synthetic gradients would be able solve these problems. The mechanisms behind synthetic gradients and how they work on different models, like RNN, is also covered. Students are not required to understand the entirety of the blog. Having a basic understanding of the problems synthetic gradients are designed to solve is sufficient for the lecture.\n",

For people who are interested in the topic, this 16-page paper is where they would be able to learn the details not covered in the blog.
